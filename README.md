# Machine Learning - Zero to GBMs

My submissions for the course Zero to GBMs by [Jovian.ai](https://jovian.ai)

### Course Project - Driver Alertness Detection

Driving while distracted, fatigued or drowsy may lead to accidents. Activities
that divert the driver's attention from the road ahead, such as engaging in a
conversation with other passengers in the car, making or receiving phone calls,
sending or receiving text messages, eating while driving or events outside the
car may cause driver distraction. Fatigue and drowsiness can result from
driving long hours or from lack of sleep.

### Problem Statement

The objective of this challenge is to design a detector/classifier that will
detect whether the driver is alert or not alert, employing any combination of
vehicular, environmental and driver physiological data that are acquired while
driving.
